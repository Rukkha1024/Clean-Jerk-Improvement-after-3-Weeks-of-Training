# Introduction 


In weightlifting competitions, athletes compete in the snatch and clean and jerk events, with the highest combined total from three attempts determining the final rankings. The basic principle of weightlifting is for the athlete to exert maximum force against the resistance of the barbell, overcoming that resistance and successfully executing the prescribed movements. In weightlifting, even the slightest, imperceptible changes in posture can significantly impact an athlete's performance. Therefore, in addition to strength, athletes must acquire highly refined techniques to achieve optimal results.

The clean and jerk consists of two consecutive technical movements: the clean, where the barbell is lifted to the chest, and the jerk, where the barbell is lifted overhead from the chest. 윤정환 & 이석구 (2004) classified the clean into six events and five phases. Similarly, 박태민 et al. (2009) classified the jerk into five events and four phases. 

However, in this experiment, the difficulty of the movements was reduced by starting with the hang clean instead of the power clean and modifying the split jerk to a push jerk, considering that the participants were not elite athletes specializing in weightlifting but rather the general population and undergraduate students majoring in physical education. Consequently, the clean was classified into three events and two phases, while the jerk was classified into four events and three phases for the purpose of this experiment.

This experiment measured how well participants performed the modified clean and jerk movements after three weeks of practice. Pre-assessment, mid-assessment, and final assessment were conducted weekly, with both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. All assessments were recorded using a camera. Quantitative evaluation measured changes in the participant's stride length and time between phases, while qualitative evaluation was based on the subjective judgment of the demonstrator.


# Results 

The present experiment focused on the extent to which learning the Clean & Jerk technique could improve the participants' form, targeting beginners. The common issues exhibited by all participants during the pre-assessment were largely resolved in the final assessment. Setting specific goals based on the assessment results and providing supplementary learning through video materials can be said to have had a significant impact on improving the participants' form. 

However, while the participants' form clearly showed significant improvement in the final assessment compared to the pre-assessment, the limitations of the experiment include the need for more quantitative measurements and the lack of a standardized scale for qualitative measurements. 

Furthermore, as the participants practiced only the Clean & Jerk movement without training in supplementary exercises or stretching, the degree of improvement in the participants' form could have been further enhanced if supplementary exercises and stretching were included.
